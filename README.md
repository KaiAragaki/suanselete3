This package is an unofficial companion to the textbook "Survival
Analysis - A Self-Learning Text" by D.G. Kleinbaum and M. Klein (3rd
Ed., 2012) including all the accompanying datasets.

## Datasets

In the order you'll likely need them:

- `evans`: (Ch 2, p 87) From the [Evans Country Heart Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_County_Heart_Study). Included purely for convenience: all the data are present in the book, this just avoids manual data entry.
- `anderson`: (Ch 2, p 89) Remission survival time for leukemia patients, with or without a new treatment ([The Effect of 6-Mercaptopurine on the Duration of Steroid-induced Remissions in Acute Leukemia: A Model for Evaluation of Other Potentially Useful Therapy](https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V21.6.699.699))
- `vets`: (Ch2, p 91) Lung cancer trial data from the Veterans Administration.
- `addicts`: (Ch2, p 91) From "[Methadone dosage and retention of patients in maintenance treatment ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1988793/)", by Caplehorn and Bell (1991). Also used in the Computer Appendix, page 526.
- `bladder` (Appendix, p 527): Interval data for bladder cancer patients after TURBT, with patients who received placebo or thiotepa. Inappropriately referred to as Byar and Green, 1980 on page 527 in the book (that study is appropriately referenced on p 433), but is actually Byar, 1980 ([The Veterans Administration Study of Chemoprophylaxis for Recurrent Stage I Bladder Tumours: Comparisons of Placebo, Pyridoxine and Topical Thiotepa](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4613-3030-1_74))
